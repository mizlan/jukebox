jukebox
================================================================================

jukebox is a wrapper around youtube-dl that does a few useful things.

Almost everything is done using pipes.


Examples
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Add a song to the default directory ~/jb/songs configurable through $SONG_DIR:

  $ cat 'https://youtube.com/...' | jb a

Select a song using the default filter fzf and play it using the default
player afplay:

  $ jb s1 | jb p

Use `vis -` as a Unix filter and select multiple songs to shuffle and play
(uses shuf from GNU coreutils):

  $ MULTI_FILTER="vis -" jb s | shuf | jb p

Playlists are just plaintext files that contain IDs. To make a playlist from a
filter selection:

  $ mkdir -p ~/jb/playlists
  $ jb s > ~/jb/playlists/classical-music

To play the playlist, pipe it into jukebox to play:

  $ cat ~/jb/playlists/classical-music | jb p

To play it shuffled, just shuffle the lines of input:

  $ cat ~/jb/playlists/classical-music | shuf | jb p
